        Finding Object, It's Properties and Methods are The main mechanism of learning Object Oriented Programming . Object is the main thing in OOP. But Object is not Everything.

    /*
        class -> Object 

        Instance Properties: What they have
            - name
            - age
            - height

        Instance Methods: What they do
            - talk
            - run
            -jump

    /*
        OOP has main four Pillar:
            1. Abstraction
                -- Abstraction means Hiding The Implementation Details Inside and Providing Just The Necessary API. We Never Know How It is Working , We Only Know What to Do.

            2. Encapsulation
                -- The definition of Encapsulation is "the action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule". Encapsulation means that each object in your code should control it's own state. State is current "snapshot" of your object.

            3. Inheritance
                -- The ability of creating a new class from an existing class. Inheritence is when an object acquires the property of another object. Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and behavior of another class.

            4. Polymorphism
                -- Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: Poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms.So Polymorphism means many "forms".
    */

    /*
        There are Two types of relation in OOP:
            1. IS A RELATION ---- INHERITANCE
            2. HAS A RELATION ---- COMPOSITION, AGGREGATION
